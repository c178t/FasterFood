This app helps you find food even faster. It allows you to input what type of food you are feeling and finds the 5 best matches of food locations near you.
The app will also display the approximate distance of the location from the user for reference. It also includes the address for ease. If 5 good locations are unable to be found,
the user will be prompted with an error message that says less than 5 locations were found. I used IpGeolocation API to find the location of the user. I then input that location into the
Yelp fusion API along with the user preference to output local business data relevant for the user.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I feel like I really got a feel for making javafx apps now. They don't seem as scary as before. I also learned a lot about API's and how they are used everywhere.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would probably plan out my project on paper more. Most of this project I just did from my head with no planning. Having a plan on paper can make the execution of the app
and the look of the app a lot better.
